Class names need to be written in **UpperCamelCase** according to the subject

---

Write class names in UpperCamelCase format. Files containing class code will
always be named according to the class name. For instance:
ClassName.hpp/ClassName.h, ClassName.cpp, or ClassName.tpp. Then, if you
have a header file containing the definition of a class "BrickWall" standing for a
brick wall, its name will be BrickWall.hpp.

We can use everything from standard library of C++ (YEAH!). 

We should get rid of leaks too in C++. Then, be aware of leaks using **new**
